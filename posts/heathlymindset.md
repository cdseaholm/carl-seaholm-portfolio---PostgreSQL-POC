# Keeping a healthy Mindset and Getting Out of Those Depressive Ruts

Everyone has been there. You’ve been laying in bed for what seems like countless hours. You roll over to check the time. The light from your phone plants a headache in the temple of your head that will gnaw at you over the next 24 hours. Your eyes set on the time and it’s 2 am, it has been countless hours. The frustration from not being able to sleep settles into your chest and elevates your heart rate, which only keeps you from sleep longer. This infuriates you more and the never ending cycle begins until you’re so exhausted that you pass out in one of the next few days.

As you lay awake, you go over every painstaking stumble and mistake you’ve made, adding unavoidable anxiety to an existential dread. I constantly find myself in this state, but how is it that someone can pull themselves out of it? It’s something that I am still trying to figure out. 

I think a lot of it goes back to my post on the 4 Pillars of Health but consistently doing it and distracting yourself. Helping your body and mind work in tandem to create a stronger overall unit. The biggest and best thing to do is to just stay present. Meditating and focusing on breathing always helps me. One of favorite quotes by Lao Tzu, “If you are depressed you are living in the past. If you are anxious you are living in the future. If you are at peace you are living in the present.” This quote really rings true and when you begin to think about existentialism or have nostalgia flash backs, it’s good to have a game plan to fall back on. Staying present and focusing on the task at hand it sometimes the only thing you can do. 

You are a work in progress. We want big events and big changes to happen all at once. However, they take time and are accumulated by small, seemingly insignificant events taking place over time. A single snowflake is what starts an avalanche.

For me though, so far a few things really help and a few really only set me back further. 

### What tends to set me back

Laying in bed feeling sorry for myself

Continuing to play video games and ignore the problem

Drinking

All of these things are not the cause but a defense mechanism to avoid what is really wrong. I believe a lot of what makes people sad or depressed (aside from potential genetic or environmental problems), stems from the understanding that they aren’t doing what they want, what they are capable of or what makes them happy. Even having one hobby to fall back on can help a lot. No drinking is not a hobby. It’s a depressant that can have lasting effects up to 8 days afterwards. Don’t get me wrong, it’s a great social lubricant but it has terrible effects on health, mentally and physically. Regardless, having a hobby to engulf yourself in is the best. When was the last time that you lost track of time doing something, just being in the moment? That’s the feeling I think we should all chase. 

### What tends to help me

4 Pillars of Health (Working out, eating right, fasting and yoga/meditation)

Working on a project

Being honest with myself

Taking a break from drinking

Getting outside (Seasonal Depression is a real thing)

Taking breaks to both enjoy my hobbies and enjoy freedom.

For me, taking time to just play guitar, write, read, go for walk/run outside are hands down the best. I get to the gym daily but still I can tell how lethargic I feel based on how poor my workout was. In those times I really try to push myself and just clear the drain pipes of all the gunk so to speak. 

Getting out in nature is another thing I think that is very important. When you live in an area like Denver, you go to work, it’s dark, you go home, it’s dark. It’s very difficult to stay positive. This is where being honest comes into play. Let yourself know it’s okay to have these feelings. Get away from social media, take a walk, breath in fresh air. Additionally, you don’t want to let your hobbies or fun become work, take breaks from it and understand that that is okay. There’s so much you can do to improve your mindset that it’s kind of funny when you look back and wonder why you were sad at all. 

On a final note, I don’t think there is a single person who hasn’t felt this way. There are people that get over it better, there are others that let their mood dictate a whole year, and there are others that are great at ignoring this feeling (which I kind of see as not such a good way to deal with it). The best thing to do is try to understand yourself, your emotions, be honest and figure out a game plan to continue to push forward. Like the great Kurt Cobain said, “Wanting to be someone else is a waste of the person you are.” I think that living with yourself is hard for everyone, just the intelligent ones recognize the mistakes and aren’t able to get past them. Solely because they are the ones that deep down know how much they have to give, they are the ones that understand the consequences of mistakes and fuck ups. They are the ones that want to be perfect so badly, yet they fixate on the little things that get in the way and separate them from being perfect. Well, no one is perfect  and it’s not good to only see yourself for your mistakes or triumphs, you need to see the both. So, be your triumphs, but understand your mistakes. Ultimately, at the end of the day, the only person’s opinion that matters is your own.
