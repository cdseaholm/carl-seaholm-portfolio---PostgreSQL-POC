# Our Purpose in life

As people get older, there can be a realization of insignificance in the world. A lot of people ignore it and go on with their daily lives. Some embrace, others fear it daily. I think understanding and accepting it is more important for determining your purpose in life. Humans have a sensational ability to be extremely individual within billions of equally unique individuals. With that individuality, comes a great personality, with that personality, comes dreams, and through dreams comes purpose. 

Each unique purpose is extremely daunting, found or unfounded, but why? It should exciting, amazing and enticing to each of us. To me it seems obvious that it’s the sense of the unknown that scares us more than anything. Questions like, will it work? Will I fail? What will I do if I fail? An evolutionary response to keep us safe in much more dangerous times. It’s why we are afraid of the dark, not knowing what waits in the shadows (which is where our fear of monsters, like wolves, in the dark come from in my opinion).

Despite what we might be told in the media, we are living in the best of times (I guess the worst of times too. Dickens probably transcends time with a statement that relies on the relation between the best and worst time in that specific era). We live in a time where the world is getting increasingly better, danger is rapidly decreasing and we are left with a sensational and possibly overwhelming amount of possibilities. The fact that we are able to take in all of the bad news of the world and see it in real time, makes the world seem much worse than it probably it. Call me an optimist but I think this world is and will continue to become better. So ignoring the media that just wants you for ratings, ignoring the unknown and ignoring the fear that comes from the unknown, you’re left with what? Your purpose here.

To me, there are two branches of thought on ones purpose in life. An evolutionary purpose and a self-made purpose. 

## Evolutionary Purpose

Pretty simply said, the purpose of a human being is to pass on their genetic code to ensure that the version that they are as an animal survives. Survival, the crux that all life hangs its hat on. Every cell, every virus, trying everything it can, to pass on and grow itself or offspring. Some working in tandem, some disputing, but regardless, each living being inherently wants to be lived on, in the future. Every individual believes they are the best, or has something to offer and thus wants to pass on their DNA. There are obvious outliers, but we are talking in general terms. 

When the next question then becomes, well then why aren’t we immortal? Nicholas Christakis posed a very interesting answer to this question. It would evolutionarily inefficient to make immortal creatures. There are external and internal risks to life. If you take out all of the internal risks, you are still left with external risks (falling trees, meteors, etc.) and thus, beings would still die. Ruining all the work the evolutionary process has done to provide immortality, hence making it inefficient. This isn’t the definite answer, but a thoughtful and interesting one. 

But let’s say we as humans do become immortal. We have populated the planet, and sufficiently stabilized to where we do not have children anymore, we live in harmony and there is only us. What is the purpose then? It would be a self made purpose. 

## Self-Made Purpose

Living in a free country where we are allowed to do basically anything we please, has its advantages and I get that. However, as we live in this country and a lot of other great countries, you can do whatever it is that you love. Sure, you might have to find time and build your way up to fully devoting your life to it. But that makes you fight for it more and potentially love it more. It’s that grind and that battle for what you love that makes you love it more. 

You can find purpose in music, in religion, in family, in friends, in the world. Whatever it is, slowly engulf yourself in it and kneel before it as a servant. It should make minutes feel like seconds, it should be so encompassing that you can do nothing but focus on it alone. If you find yourself not enjoying it, becoming distracted and it becomes something you force yourself to do, take a break. See if something else is catching your eye or if you’re just engulfing yourself too much. Resting is important too. Often times, things we like, lead us to what it is we want in the end. And giving up on it does not mean you’ve lost purpose or meaning. It solely means your focus has shifted and as a growing, living and learning being, that is ok.

Now, as we obviously are not immortal and time is more fleeting. Does this diminish the purpose you should create for yourself? If anything, to me, it enhances it. So find how you can chase those experiences or hobbies. Make time for it, realize that your life is an accumulation of what you do now, and just go for it. The only ones that will hate you are the ones that hate themselves for not trying. What people say about you, is what they subconsciously believe about themselves.

## True Purpose

Overall, I believe the true purpose is a mixture of the both. To raise a family, train and grow the next generation as best as we can. Preparing them to find what it is that they love and want to do. All while filling our time with as many meaningful experiences and people as possible. --
