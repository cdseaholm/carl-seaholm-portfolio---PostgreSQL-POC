Back in July of 2018 when I was doing my Goggins (LINK) challenge, there were days I literally could not walk up and down the stairs. My legs begging for the relief of the couch, a blanket and a long nap after being having my feet slammed into the pavement for an hour. A lot of runs were actually really peaceful and beautiful once the runner’s high kicked in, which is a very real thing. However, the one muscle in my body that hurt the most was my IT band. 

The IT band is a muscle that runs down the outside of each of your legs. The IT band (Iliotibial band) is meant to extend, abduct and laterally rotate the hip. It also helps to stabilize your knees. Now when I started running, I just ran, I didn’t focus on form at all and it was a costly mistake. There were days that I couldn’t bend or do anything without my muscles aching. 

Before I started running, I did like to stretch but it was nothing extensive and was just a minute or two of stretching, which is better than nothing but didn’t help with this month. 

So I started looking in to how to reduce this pain and it was all the same advice. Good form and yoga. Doing stretches with a foam roller and specifically stretching out the IT band. 

I began by stretching 15 minutes in the morning, 15-30 after my workout and 15 minutes before bed. This is actually still my routine and I focus on relaxation and flexibility. David Goggins (I know I already talk about him too much) actually talks about how he started to stretch 2 hours every night now. This has help improve the length of his stride and take a full minute off of his runs, just from stretching. Obviously stretching for 2 hours is out of question for all of us mere mortals but the same thing applies, we all should be doing yoga. Not only is it great for our body, but it’s good for our mind too.
