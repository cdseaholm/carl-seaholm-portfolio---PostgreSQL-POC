# Colorado to San Diego

Living in Colorado for 80% of my life has been amazing. I have lots of memories and plenty that will last me my whole life. It might be dramatic but Colorado has meant a lot to me. 

I moved out here when I was 5 for my fathers work. The last memory I have of leaving Illinois is saying goodbye to my then best friend and crying while staring out the back window. The same best friend who gave me my first black eye because I ran into his forehead. The pain of leaving others doesn’t get easier, you just become to understand the reasons why. The first memory I have of Colorado is walking through our current house and seeing the previous owners, sons, toy Millennium Falcon. That room would be the room I spent pretty much twenty years in. Peering out the window through Spring, Summer, Fall and Winter, watching the Rocky Mountains stay a solemn constant through a lot of change. 

Below that exact spot where I would stare through my window, was Boulder. Probably my favorite place in Colorado, as I went to college there. A place where I slowly attempted to realize who I am, which I am still figuring out. It feels like an Act is closing in my life and it’s an odd feeling since you don’t normally have real succinct moments that define an ending or beginning. As the new beginning progresses, I plan to grow and learn more about myself in a different space, hoping to add another portion to a still young life. 

Colorado will always feel like a second home behind Chicago, which I don’t really know why since I only lived there for 5 years. All of which I barely remember. However, home isn’t a place you grow, and since this is a progressive blog, it’s time to step into bigger waters and see what else there is. I’ve gone to college in Colorado, high school, made all my friends here, learned here, even started a company and this blog here. So as I move to San Diego, I wonder what else it may bring. 

Surprisingly, some of my biggest progress has come from a 6 month job at Vivax Pros (Where I am currently writing this… sorry Des). I have honed my habits and activities to be more productive here. Trying to be someone more that I myself would want to look up to. Giving way to friends that have supported my writing, reading and fitness. It’s amazing the steps you can take when you have phenomenal individuals surrounding you that cheer you on through each step. 

In terms of San Diego though, it may only be a one year stint. It may be the rest of my life. Regardless of what happens, my only duty is to seize the moments my past has presented me with (no pun intended) and work with it. As I’ve said before, we are an accumulation of each present moment, granting us a current passing of the torch between the past and future. So I can’t say what San Diego will bring, but I will try my hardest to take every day and let it bring me joy, peace and a lot more progress.
