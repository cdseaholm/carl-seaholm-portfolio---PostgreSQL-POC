# A brief history of Cleopatra

Over the weekend I saw Captain Marvel. I really enjoyed the movie but it was a basic Marvel origin story. I really love Marvel movies, however their origin stories are all the same at the base level. What really sold it for me was Bri Larson. She was strong, confident and a lot of fun. When I left the theatre I was sad that the experience of the movie was over, solely because I wouldn’t get to see her take on Captain Marvel for some time. Needless to say I’m excited to see her in Endgame and see her in further Marvel movies, if the storyline is compelling and Larson continues to kill it in that role, then keep the movies coming!

Anyways, seeing the movie got me thinking about one woman in history. An iconic woman that is probably the oldest and most widely recognized depiction of a strong woman that has actually lived. The woman in name is Cleopatra. I know the basics about her story, but most of it has been glamorized by Hollywood and what not. I took a Roman history class in college and she was overshadowed by Mark Antony, Cesar and Octavian. What I want to know, is more about the Egyptian princess and how she got from where she was, to where she would end up.

Obviously the culture in Egypt was much different than the rest of the world, but she might have been the first woman to encapsulate men, not for her beauty but her intelligence too. There were reports that her lack of beauty was actually irrelevant to Romans, so who is to say someone is beautiful when two cultures are deciding. It was her presence that was unmistakable. She was born in 69 B.C. and born into royalty. In 49 B.C. she attempted to take sole sovereignty over Egypt even though she was co-ruling then with Pharaoh Ptolemy XIII (Also her husband/brother… yep).

When this plan fell through, she fled to Syria where she brought back a Mercenary group. Right now all I can imagine is if the Egyptians had dragons and her real name is Daenerys Targaryen (if you don’t get that joke, you’ve got bigger problems than learning about Cleopatra). This also makes me wonder if George R. R. Martin took inspiration from Cleopatra for the mother of dragons. 

Without going too much into politics of the time, Egypt was a sort of ally to Rome, helping to preserve the Nile Valley for trade and ship routes. Cesar and Rome were actually stationed near Alexandria around this time which would benefit Cleopatra.

Now that she had an army and wanted to over take sol ownership of the Egyptian thrown, Cleopatra went to Cesar and asked for help. She actually wrapped herself in carpet and literally rolled herself out for him. The theatrical metaphor here is pretty hard to miss. He accepted, helped to give her the throne through a civil war and she ended up giving him a child. She was about 22 at the time.

After the civil war, she married her other brother Ptolemy XIV (Yep.. that’s the way it was done). When Cesar was assassinated, she ended up killing off any challenges to her son, this included her husband/brother and sister. It was the way of the Egyptians, ruthless. But reports don’t pin her as a ruthless person. She was very much so for her people, being named, Philopatris, “she who loves her country.” She also attempted to keep Egypt’s independence from Rome who was ever expanding. She sided with Mark Antony whom she loved. She hoped he would be the end of Octavian who was Cesar’s such
