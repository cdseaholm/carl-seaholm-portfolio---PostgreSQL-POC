# You Are A Badass Review

You Are A Badass by Jen Sincero is the first self-help/motivational book I’ve ever read fully. I’ve read excerpts from books like The Color Code by Taylor Hartman (which was actually pretty interesting, just dense) and others, but this is the first one I have finished.

I have to say that every day I read this book, I really looked forward to it. Most self help books, I dread to read because they are mucked down with over complicated lectures about how you are a mess. This book however takes from Jen’s experiences and explains how something went awry and how she fixed it or how it fixed her. Then from there, how it can benefit you. She coats the book in an overabundance of love and support, which you’d expect from every self help book, but don’t get.

I don’t want to speak too much about the book because I want everyone to read it in their own terms, but she splits up the book in very easily read chapters. Within each chapter, she breaks down the pieces of it bit by bit bullet points, so you can easily digest the message within. Plus she ends nearly every chapter with, “Love yourself.” Which, I have to tell you, somedays I really needed. 

I also had read this at a very interesting time in my life, as I started to read it a week after I started my blog. It helped me get through the initial steps of starting something you aren’t quite comfortable with. Of course I know nothing good happens in the comfort zone as Richard Branson famously quoted, but it’s still not something that’s easy to practice. The book became a sort of stilt that I could rely on as I incessantly critiqued every word I typed onto my new blog. Obviously I’ll get better with time, I didn’t need a book to tell me that, but it helped getting the reassurance that I wasn’t as crazy as I thought I was. So I’m sure anyone can take a lesson or get help from this book. 

Every day after reading this book, I felt like I wanted to be kinder. I also felt smarter, better and happier. If a self help book doesn’t do that for me going forward, I really don’t see the reason to read it. This in turn, made me look forward to reading it every day like I said before. She has also written, You are a Badass Everyday, You are a Badass at Making Money, and The Straight Girl’s Guide to Sleeping with Chicks. I highly recommend this book if you’re looking for an afternoon pick me up or if you’re struggling to find your groove
