# A challenge I'll never do again

July 15th 2018: I’m lacing up my shoes to go on a 4 am run, nearing the completion of my 48 miles in 48 hours. The lack of sleep creating a fog around my eyes and the impending 4 mile run looming heavy over me. I thought about the past month of insane workouts. When I say insane, I mean over the top, soul-breaking type workouts. This is not to say I’m some iron willed, unbreakable person. Just to say that there were days I legitimately thought about quitting my workouts. Days my legs hurt so bad I couldn’t walk downstairs to my bedroom. Days that I nearly passed out on a backroad because I didn’t wear sun protection or bring water on a 17 mile run (like an idiot). 

Back in the beginning of June, right before I began doing this month long test, I was working at a Golf Course near my house and felt I wasn’t reaching my potential or using my time appropriately. I was listening to a Joe Rogan podcast where he was talking to a man named Jesse Itzler who had just written a book called Living With a Seal (photo). Jesse is the owner of the Atlanta Hawks NBA team and owner of a coconut water company. He previously had lived with monks for 3 months and is dedicated to improving what he calls is his “life resume.” Through-out the book, Jesse invited a navy seal to live with him and told the marine, I will do any workout you tell me to do for a month. The Navy Seal accepted and really worked Jesse. I should mention that Jesse was already a marathon runner and I was absolutely not. Maybe running a mile here and there, I wanted to see where my limits were. I highly recommend you read this book because the way it’s told is a really great and quick read. 

Seal’s name is redacted from the book, but has come out as the one and only, David Goggins. A navy seal and an absolute madhouse for pushing his limits. His book Can’t Hurt Me just came out and is overly motivational. If you can’t find motivation from him and his life, I don’t think you’ll find motivation anywhere. Starting at 300 pounds, he lost over 100 pounds in 3 months after an officer told him he was too heavy to be in the Navy Seals. He now, as far as I read, is the first man to be admitted to each special branch of the military. In other words, been admitted and passed the tests for the Navy Seals, Marines and Rangers. Like I said, if that doesn’t impress you, I’m not sure what will. 

Through the entirety of the month, I ran about 250 miles and 20,000 pushups (ADD) Beginning on June 9th, 2018, I set out to start this month off. It was a bit longer than one month, so the excess will get added to Week 4. The first week consisted of what Goggins said was building a base. Below is what I did on the first week Week 2 is when the really difficult workouts began. I say this, however every week got more and more challenging. Week 2 was much more physically challenging. Week 3 was much more mental and week 4 was a mental and physical combination where both were beyond what week 2 and 3 had stored into it. 

Again, read this book and Can’t Hurt Me. You will find plenty of motivation from these two books alone. Goggins and Itzler are amazing people to look up to.
