# Critiquing Art in Your Own Way

We critique things every day. We critique the way people say a specific phrase, we critique the tweet someone puts out, the way people dress, the way we ourselves are coming off. Even films or music. It’s the way we subconsciously gauge something or someone based on societal present and past norms. When you go to a movie, the first words after the movie are typically, “What did you think?” Maybe you are moved to tears by the movie, maybe it was a hot pile of garbage that was a waste of $12. When you listen to music, you are encapsulated by the tone and you are set in that style of music you are listening to, this might connect with you, it might clash with your preferences. 

When it comes to Art, we are grown up just seeing it all around us as more or less, background noise. Never the main focus but always improving and accenting the surrounding subject. However, when we go to an Art Museum we are endlessly bored. Well, why is that? I believe it’s for two reasons. One, the emotion, reason and thought isn’t given to us in the way it is with music or movies. We are supposed to think on it ourselves, and you know as well as I that humans don’t like doing more than the bare minimum (Most of us at least). Secondly, it’s because we are never taught how to exam the art itself and understand what it’s trying to tell us. 

Everything is artistic in nature, the way that your computer is made, the color and design of the building you work in, the design of apps, etc. However I think that Art and artistic preferences are much different. Google defines art as, “The expression or application of human creative skill and imagination, typically in a visual form such as painting or sculpture, producing works to be appreciated primarily for their beauty or emotional power.” This is not to say that music is not art, but visual art is meant to represent something (could be beauty) and/or evoke emotion. It can also be meant to capture a moment for what it is, like Realism. 

The nice thing about art is that it is all subjective, there was a main focus the artist had in mind, but it might come off completely differently to people. The way I view or critique a work is going to be influenced by my upbringing, culture, my family and friends, and if I’ve read anything on the piece itself. Abstract art is a great example of this, no one is really going to be able to tell you what the artist was truly intending, except for the artist (Unless the person read a book on the artist and thus understand the intent of the piece, but I’ll bet anything 99% of people bullshit their way through it). It could just be a nice landscape, like photography, meant to capture the beauty in nature. It could be an impressionist painting (LINK) meant to capture the essence of a fleeting moment. It’s all subjective after a certain point and if anyone tells you your opinion is wrong, especially if it’s more modern art, then who cares what they think. Art is meant to make you feel the way it makes you feel and that is what I think Art is truly about. Evoking emotion through wordless, soundless pieces that display a certain image. Now, the way that I view art can be completely different from anyone else’s. I think that when something in terms of art is made, you can’t put rules around it otherwise you lose the point of what makes art, art. That being said, how I view art is usually in 3 parts: 

### Factual Basis of the Piece

For me, this is a good starting point if you are actively looking at art and critiquing it, even if it’s casual, doing this will get you more familiar.

### Look for the Time Period

This might give you indication to the style and how it’s supposed to look based on it’s time.

### Look for the Artist

This might give you indication to the style as well, as well as their personal quirks in their painting.

### How it makes you Feel

This is where the meat of your critiquing can come from. Does the piece evoke the correct emotion a specific style? If a picture is worth 1,000 words, then which words are being used and how?

### Judgement of the piece

Now combine the past two parts. This is where I decide if the emotion or story that was given to me, fits the frame of the time it was made and the narrative that it’s trying to give off? 

Ask other questions like, is it original? Does it convey the message appropriately? Do you think it’s good or bad?

Let’s take a look at a photographic image of a forest. It’s taken a few years ago, it’s high resolution, the green is vibrant. For me, a photo like that will give me a yearning for nature and escape from civilization. A sadness and nostalgia for lush green drives through dense woods. Maybe mixed with a dash of wanderlust. Landscape photography is some of the most popular art there is. It’s obviously much more modern, but it’s easy to evoke emotion in me because a lot of my childhood was surrounded by great lands in Colorado. So for me, it connects well and the message of connecting with nature is very apparent to me.

Based on my feelings and understanding of it, I’ll give an overall basis of how I’ve viewed the piece and my understanding of it. Just because I don’t like or understand certain paintings, doesn’t mean that someone else’s opinion isn’t right. I think that’s why a lot of people don’t attempt viewing art, they think they don’t know anything about it so they don’t try. Guess what? No one knows anything, fake it till you make it. 

Finally, I think that modern art is very difficult to judge because you have a specific art opposing itself to past arts to make it’s own presence and space known. Just like Impressionism was rejected by Realism, and Realism rejected by Romanticism before that. Imagine your grandmother is sewing together a glove, if she is halfway finished, you’d think, “Nice try Grandma, but that’s a horrendous glove.” Just like modern art, it develops itself through all the artists attempting to create new and different art at that time. That’s why I also think that artists are often more revered after they are dead. In the times that the art is being created, it’s rejected by previous art eras, but once the whole era of that style has been shown in it’s entirety, certain artists can be seen for their genius. 

You can think of it as a pasta making line, the string of pasta never ends, but you cut it up once it becomes long enough because otherwise you’d have one giant piece of spaghetti. Each era creating until the style has been set and then clipped for new artists to go against the grain they have set. Same with music, Rock wasn’t always rock. It was classical guitar, then blues, then jazz, then classic rock, etc. Then you have different cultures throwing in their mix with their different eras. It’s a living thing that’s entirely connected and compartmentalized all the same. Art is beautiful, strange, wonderful, terrible and creative. So take some time and try to understand that confusing mess for what it is, which is life captured by art.
