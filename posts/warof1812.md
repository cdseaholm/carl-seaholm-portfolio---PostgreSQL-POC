Over the weekend, I was listening to a podcast they briefly discuss the War of 1812. As the two of them briefly made mentions to the war, I realized I really didn’t know too much about the war even though I had heard of it, many times over my life.

Most every American should know that the American Revolution was from 1765 to 1783. Through out most of history, succeeding from another country is a messy and complicated business. Luckily, the United States of America had some of the most progressive and thorough leaders within the respective social and political climate of the time, opting to be a country for the people, by the people. 

As the American Revolution ended, the obvious first steps for a new country, is setting up policy, trade and potential expansion, if possible. (There are obvious other varying factors). Now, in attempting to do the best for it’s people, America turned it’s eyes west in hopes for expansion. Regardless of your ideas certain subjects such as expansion through force, the mistreatment of certain races or other seemingly grim aspects of it’s past, America was doing what it deemed best for itself, at that time, as a new and growing country.

Now, since the American Revolution ended and the Treaty of Paris recognized the United States as a country of it’s own, you could say that England was fairly salty. Any powerful and prideful country is going to be upset after losing a major war to a band of misfits, so to speak, and in turn losing a massive piece of land. There are certain sources saying that England meddled in American Trade and expansion. 

At the time, England and France were preparing for the economic wreckage that the Napoleonic Wars (1803-1815) would bring and both countries asked the USA to stay out of the war. However, the USA made a massive trade with France for $15 million dollars (About $325 million today) in order to help their expansion desires. We know this as the Louisiana Purchase. 

As time went on, the war raged and certain acts, such as the Non-Importation act of 1806, were put in place as England continued to violate trade rights and agreements. Additionally, England, who desperately needed soldiers, would capture American troops and force them to fight for England. Overtime, America realized it would be undermined as a country, as well as their independence, if they allowed these things to continue, engaging in war with England. 

Defeat after defeat, England actually managed to capture the capital and America seemed too demoralized. Upon trying to capture Baltimore, Maryland, England bombed Baltimore for 24 hours. Realizing that they couldn’t fight wars on both sides, England made a final decision. On the morning of Sept 14 1814, when the bombing stopped at “dawn’s early light,” and England retreated, it seemed America had survived the worst of it. Then, out of it and the sight of what had happened, Francis Scott Key wrote a song about the triumph, which would soon be known as the star spangled banner. 

History continues to amaze me that there are so many little details I will never be able to fully encapsulate. However, studying these individual moments one after another, allows me to have a better understanding of how we got to where we are today.
