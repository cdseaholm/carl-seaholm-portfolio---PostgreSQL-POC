Over the weekend I was listening to a podcast with Naval Ravikant, who is the owner of AngelList. He brought up a fantastic point about thinking about less. What he means by this is exactly what it sounds like, we are happier when we think about less. 

The times were I get flustered and overwhelmed, is when I have several thoughts running rampant and pulling me in different directions, stretching me thin. As I get older, I really want to become happier, which is one of the main reason why I began this blog in the first place. To create a space where I can organize my thoughts and find out how to effectively take hold of my life. Now, in order to cultivate a happier life, regardless if my life goes according to plan or not, I need to think about less and just enjoy what’s in front of me. There are three actions I think I can take to make a happier life overall: 

Meditating, staying present

Becoming aware when I am getting overwhelmed

Using Naval’s 3-day rule (1st day is an emotional hangover, 2nd day is residue, 3rd day is staying present and moving on. This may be brutal but it’s meant to keep you happier)

There’s a quote I mention often, which is, “If you are depressed you are living in the past. If you are anxious you are living in the future. If you are at peace you are living in the present.” - Lao Tzu
