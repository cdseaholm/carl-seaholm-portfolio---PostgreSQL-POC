Through out the week I usually work out, at the minimum, 5 days a week. Some weeks I will work out 7 days a week. My best was going 2 months straight of working out. I don’t really see working out as a something that I need, want, or have to do. While it is all those things and more, it’s something I simply just do. 

When I work out, I take the core of my workout and build around it. I really like to have about 2 hours of from warm-up to cool down, however i can make hour workouts happen and do it fairly often. 

Lately, I have been working on quieting my inner voice that tells me not to do something and just doing whatever is required of me that day. You can call it the devil on your shoulder or “inner bitch,” as David Goggins calls it. No ifs, ands, or buts, just simply do it. Your mind will give you plenty of reasons not to do something, but if you ignore it and do what you set out to do, it has amazing benefits. After my workouts, I feel relaxed, euphoric and confident, especially if I hit every goal I laid out for myself. I mentioned this in a previous post, but that's why the military makes you make your bed every morning; hitting goals, no matter how small really improves your confidence and self reliance. 

Pair this with the other 3 pillars and you will feel great! Trust me, this really works and I feel great every day because of it, but you have to work at and I still have to get better with it.

Now, looking at the workout cores, I laid out a 7 day workout week here. If it’s a 5 or 6 day week, I will cut out the 500 club or legs depending. 


## Workout Cores:

### Monday

Chest, Tricep

### Tuesday

Legs

### Wednesday

Back, Bicep

### Thursday

Chest, Shoulders

### Friday

Legs

### Saturday

500 club

### Sunday

Legs

From here, I essentially just plug the core into my workout rotation. I usually try and switch up my workouts monthly to avoid stagnation. I will explain each step below.

## Warm-up



### Cardio (Pick 1, maybe 2)

	-Mile run

		-Lately I’ve been running a mile on U-shaped treadmills because they are self powered and burn more calories. Sprint the last 5% of the mile. 

	-HIIT

		I’d usually a minute warm up jog, then jog for 20 seconds, sprint all out for 10 seconds, 10 times. 

	-Jump Rope

		On leg days I will jump rope for 5 minutes straight, adding 10 seconds for each time I mess up.

	-Lately I’ve been doing planking as well as a warm up and they kill.

	-Shooting hoops for 30 minutes, not lightly but actively running around and getting to shot spots with ball handle moves. 



## Core



4 lifting workouts. Typically one body workout paired with a lifting workout for a cycled rotation. I believe a lot of people do great things when they lift weights, but they need to incorporate much more body weight exercises into their plans. When you isolate muscles with single lifts, sure you might get big, but start to combine the muscles and they can barely do one pull up. Not only does body weight exercises reduce weight, keeps you slim (which is my goal and maybe not everyone’s), it burns more calories and gets your much more used to moving your own body around, which is extremely important in terms of health. Also, as a side note, I honestly believe the bulking - cutting ideology people have is complete bullshit. It's an excuse for people to each shitty and say they are just bulking when really... to be frank... they are just fat. You can make plenty of gains while working out correctly and eating healthy. 



## Monday (Chest, Tri) example: 

Burnout Body Weight Exercise Rotation: 1->10 Push-ups,  1->10 Dips, 1 push up, 1 dip, rest 15, 2 push ups, 2 dips, rest 15, continue to 10.
10 Tricep Push downs with 10 pushups after x3
10 Skull crushers with 12 pushups after x3
Swiss ball jack knifes with push up in between x3


## Cool Down

	

-Sauna for 20 minutes

	Practice breathing and meditating for 10 minutes, additionally 5 minutes when I wake up and 5 minutes before bed.

-Yoga, stretch for 15. I also do yoga 15 minutes before bed and 5 minutes when I wake up. 

	A note on Yoga, I truly believe this is something that more people need to do. It may have stigmas attached to it such as being girly or hippyish, but I assure you, if done properly, it's difficult, you feel loose and fantastic afterwards. It helps to build strength, balance and loosen muscles. Not to mention it relaxes you and eases your mind. A lot of my friends talk about pain in shoulders, their back, their hips, I tell them all the same thing, DO YOGA. Not just a couple of stretches, but actively push yourself in yoga stretches. I rarely have any sort of joint or muscle pain and I attribute it to yoga and the inflammation reduction of a good diet and sauna. Again it goes back to the 4 pillars articles I wrote, if you take care of your body, your body takes care of you.





## Final words



With Back, Bis days, I will do pull ups and chin ups. 

Legs I will do body weight squats. 



The 500 club is from my (Goggins Link), it’s essentially where I do 100 reps without stopping of each core body workout: 

100 reps of chest press

100 reps of tricep pushdown

100 reps of bicep curl

100 reps of shoulder press

100 reps of LAT pulldown. 



If I am skipping my sunday workout, I add 100 reps of calf raises and leg press. Plus another 100 reps of russian twists (100 each side), so it becomes an 800 club. Trust me, you are dead after this. 



I will switch up my workouts monthly, swapping out the specific lifting exercises and cardio, but I keep the body weight exercises, sauna and yoga the same.
