# Italian Trip of a Lifetime

## Setting the stage

This trip to Italy started me down the path of learning, growing, realizing there is more for me to do and be in life than I ever thought possible. It's where my writing stemmed from, my love for languages, blogging (which even lead me to having a WordPress blog).

Since 2014, I have been learning Italian. It has not been easy and at times it is an absolute grind, especially when there is no one to practice with. One of the first times I actually used Italian as a means to communicate, was over the summer of 2015 when I went to Italy to visit my cousins, who live in Lucca. In the same summer, I got to see Italy through a native’s eyes, see an authentic Italian wedding, share in some Calabrese traditions and eat with members of the mafia in Sicily. First, let me back up a bit. In my bio, I wrote that learning Italian was the first time that learning something new, struck me as a thrilling and interesting new way to look at the world. This is not only because of the way it made me think differently, but the real life implications is had for me. 

I began taking Italian classes the first semester of the 2014 - 2015 year at CU Boulder. The leaves were changing, the scent of coffee hovered over campus like the Great 1952 London Fog. The daze and freedom that summer vacation offered, loomed well over everyone’s head who were still getting back into their rhythm. As little excitement as I had going back to yet another year of school, little did I know that this year, one class would offer a new path for me. I signed up for a class, just out of the random chance that I was from the same culture as the language this class offered. Italian. A romance language made to woo women and build a society centuries old. I took to the class exceptionally well, learning verb conjugations and making friends within the class. 

I eventually met an Italian girl when searching for people at CU Boulder who spoke Italian well to help me. One thing led to the next and I’m dating a girl from Rome, Italy whose mother was from Colorado and father was from Southern Italy in a province named Calabria. After about a year of dating, she invited me out to Italy to meet her family and see Rome. Being in college, being broke, wanting to see the world, I thought, “This is what college is about, right?” So I scrounged up any amount of money I got from my two jobs and tax returns, then bought a plane ticket to Italy. For those that don’t know, rent in Boulder is essentially paying a second tuition to live in a shitty 3 room apartment, it’s ridiculously overpriced, so working and going to school is a necessity for most. 

Now, for most going to Italy, having a place to stay just outside Rome, having someone to show you all the best places to eat and show you around, is an experience most aren’t lucky enough to get. I got even luckier about 2 months prior to the trip. I always knew I had cousins who lived in Sweden, but as the trip approached, my mother received a message asking if she was the daughter of Raphael Cesari. They go back and forth, turns out, when my grandfather immigrated from Italy, he left behind some brothers, who ultimately stayed behind to have families in Lucca. So, after talking with Mina, we planned to meet up with Elio and his family, making the trip even more nerve wracking, but more thrilling all the same. We had planned to go from Florence to Venice, since Lucca is just an hour to the west of Florence, it was an easy decision to skip Venice and take a day trip to Lucca. 

I should mention that when I was in fourth grade, we made a trip around Europe and I actually remember a lot of it fairly well. We even went to Lucca, not knowing we had cousins just a few steps away all those years ago.

On the flight to Rome, anticipation, nerves and wanderlust all mixed together, which really set the tone for a great trip. I embarrassingly remembered The Lizzie McGuire Movie and how excited Lizzie and Gordo were on their plane ride, needless to say I emulated that excitement. I landed and met up with Mina, meeting her family for the first time. Her brother and his girlfriend getting there a day later. Everything around me, felt old. The airport, the city, the ground, there was electricity everywhere and everything felt alive. Even the air was crisp, hot and clear. Breathing in the air felt good, felt like vacation but in a very new and safe feeling, like I had always been meant to breathe in that air… but that’s probably me just overthinking it a bit and is probably too on the nose.

## Rome

The ride from the airport was one of the first moments I had, where my awe and misunderstanding for the city really came into view. Mostly, I took in what I didn’t know about the city. When I visited Hawaii years before, the island was so little what I thought it would be, and Italy was much like that. You build these pre conceived notions of what something should be, through movies and photos and there is so much that is left unseen. It wasn’t all ancient ruins and cheesy, over the top Italian men lusting after women. As silly as it is to say, actual Italians lived there and it was very modernized. Why I thought it was only ancient ruins and pasta, is beyond me, ignorance is something that just is, until it’s confronted with facts. 

The girl’s family lived just outside of Rome in an eclectic yet very Italian neighborhood. Dry trees and green grass, dirt roads topped with gravel led the way through their narrow streets There were no buildings, only short houses and tanned walls outlined by rolling green hills and meadows but that was about it. As we turned left off the main road and drove toward a gate, a variety of animals were there to greet the car. Dogs and cats paraded the entrance as they were batted away to make room for the car to enter. Straight ahead was a shed in a fairly large yard. A fence lined with trees stretched about 50 feet in each direction. I got out of the car to view a one story house on the right, in the middle of a fairly large yard. A pool under construction, trampoline and garden spread across the front yard. The house was small, yet lovely. Homely one could say and I loved every bit of it. 

There is something very strange about the way a house or even the buildings feels in Italy. It feels as though the house is alive. The neighborhoods are not as “cookie cutter,” as in America. It feels like you’re in a villa, stone work beneath you, grand architecture above you while an oceanic breeze comes at you from every direction, the air is crisp and refreshing. The only way I can describe it, or traveling in general, is like you’re walking through a museum, but the art is engulfing you and you are the subject at the center of a story you’re creating. 

Over the next few days, we toured Rome, seeing it through a local’s eyes. The typical stops, pastry shops, pizzerias, the colosseum, the pantheon, Trevi Fountain, all of the above, were absolutely astonishing. However, nothing made me pine for Italy the way Villa Borghese did. I have always been a sucker for gardens and quality walking areas. There are many different sections of the Villa Park. There are architectural sections, surrounded by ponds and well trimmed hedges. There is a section with amusement rides and small ice cream shops. Places where horse races take place, large houses, park benches with nothing in site but trees. Even spots to overlook the entirety of Rome. Villa Borghese is just North east of the Spanish Steps and just outside the Metropolitan section of Rome. So imagine being uphill from there and peering out at a sea of construction and architecture while a Forest Park is behind you, it’s an astounding scene to behold.

## Lucca

After visiting Rome, we went north to Florence where we only stayed for two nights. We stayed in an amazing hotel overlooking the Ponte Vecchio and the main river. We saw some of the communist buildings and art galleries that were everywhere in Florence. I also bought my first suit in Italy with a pair of shoes to match, I still have them and plan to keep them for a long time. The time spent in Florence was much too quick and it was a few days that I started to become tired from all the travel. I got hangry most days but I pulled through and think I enjoyed it just as much as everything else, at least I did in my mind.

After Florence, we traveled west to Lucca. Lucca rests in between Florence and Pisa. The main town has three smaller villages surrounding it, but the main town of Lucca has a two mile wall surrounding it’s perimeter. As far as my knowledge, the walls were erected in 1500s and 1600s. Regardless, the town doesn’t get as many tourists and has an amazing smaller town feel. 

We met up with my cousin’s Elio and Oresto for lunch. This is where my exhaustion catches up with me. My cousins do not speak a lick of english, so between my broken Italian and Mina translating for me, we were both fried by the end of the day. 

The first thing I realized when meeting Elio and Oresto, was both of their heights. For Italians, each towered over 6’4, which is my height, and both had a similar build as I. I have been told I am the spitting image of my grandfather and now I see those attributes ran in that side of the family. I never got to meet my grandfather past the age of 2. So when I got off a train, in a foreign country, and I have a stranger who looks similar to myself, grabbing my neck and staring into your soul with watery eyes whispering, “Cugino. Siamo famiglia.” (Cousin. We are family.) It’s a bit overwhelming for a 21 year old. We ended up eating lunch at a small place Elio liked. Quickly my Italian dwindled into childish attempts to relate with someone who wanted to know me intimately. So, Mina became a crutch the rest of the day as we went about. We saw the town where my grandfather grew up, where my great grandparents were buried, their home, church and olive farm. And even a 50 foot statue of Pinnochio, since this was the town where the story originated. Like I said, it was an overwhelming experience. We only got one day with them, but spent another day in Lucca, walking around the perimeter before heading back to Rome. Like I said, I was fried from speaking broken Italian all day and it showed, I slept for 15 hours on the train and when we got back. Mina was a bit upset with me. Since she is bilingual by bitch essentially, she figured this would be easy. Let me assure you, testing your year old Italian skills with a relative you didn’t know, is tough.

## Calabria and Southern Italy

Returning to Rome, we were to head to Southern Italy, now to meet with my Italian girlfriend’s family, and that was an experience on it’s own. Her, adopted sister from India, stopped in Pompeii with her brother and his girlfriend. We went straight to Calabria by plane to get settled in. There is so much here to write about, so I will try to keep it to the essentials. 

The town of Limbadi is where some of the family is from. Her father's family, the Cafos, who are cousins of Mina and her father have distilled liquor there for 4 generations. Their liquor “Vecchio Amaro del Capo,” is a highly recommended brand of liquor made only in Calabria. In 2010, this was the only Italian liquor to have won a gold medal in an international competition in Brussels. You can read more about it here:

There wasn’t a lot on this but there are some articles you can find on the family if you can read Italian. 

While visiting with them, there was a town festival that happens every year. I forget specifically what it is called, but essentially, a lot of vendors come to the town. There are fireworks, a huge church sermon and giant dolls that come down the street. At the end, all of the wives of the village cook and make their special meals, then there is a mass meal where everyone in the village eats on benches laid out for the service. Let me be the first to say, the food, was unbelievable. This is hard core Italian food, no one there spoke English and I was in the heart of a very special tradition for them. It was overwhelming and insightful to how communities in Italy really come together to bond and become a stronger community. It’s similar to a block party but everyone there is related and it’s only about 200-300 people at the festival. It was really special. 

Then, her cousin’s who own the distillery, were also having a wedding. The son of the owner, head of the company was to marry a beautiful Italian woman. They wed in a small Church outside of Limadi. It was really cool to see a pure catholic wedding. It was so unbelievably hot that I don’t even think the devil would have withstood that ceremony. The cathedral indescribable and the surroundings so Italian and quaint that some tourists would pop their heads in and take photos. It was special to be on the inside. At the end, they drove off in a Ferrari (Very Italian) to meet up with us in Taormina. 

So, we met up with a lot of the family in Taormina, which is a town on the cliffs of Sicily. Imagine Santorini in Greece, but in Sicily. There are white building splayed along hill and seeming to spill down into the water. As the dinner service began, the two newly weds came in on a boat with fireworks behind them, onto a seaside venue at a 5 star restaurant. What an entrance, right? (Yes, I was super spoiled at this point) We drank, dance and ate. Unfortunately, Mina got sick and had to be taken back to the hotel across the street. I, however, ended up drinking way too much with her brother, carrying her adopted sister up a flight of stairs and being the most hungover I’ve ever been the next day. Let me be the first to tell you, wine doesn’t mess around. 

On the last few days In Limbadi, we spent lounging by the pool and eating. At one specific meal there were some very important, “businessmen,” at the lunch and I was told not to say too much about the family. So you can understand how nervous I was about this, especially not speaking Italian so well. Apparently at the wedding in a drunken stupor, I had tried to speak to one of these men… Luckily I’m still here. Hopefully, you can infer what I mean by this.

All in all, the 3 week vacation was something I will never forget. I know I’ve left a lot out, like smoking Italian weed, getting drunk at Roman bars off of pure absinthe, eating swordfish, visiting the western side of Calabria and drawing Roman architecture, poorly might I add. 

## A finale note

Hopefully my writing has not been stretched too thin, as this was a very important trip to me. As memories grow dim and stories become vague and hazy, I wanted to remember this trip as clearly as the day I was there. However, I know that time will go on, memories fade and I will need to reread this to fully remember and understand what it was that I experienced when I was 21.
