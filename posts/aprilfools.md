# Origin of April Fool’s Day

A lot of historians trace back the origins of April Fool’s Day back to 1512. What these historians point to is the changing from the Julian Calendar to the Gregorian Calendar. 

## The Julian Calendar

The Julian Calendar was put in place by Julius Cesar (I wonder if he was a narcissist). The previous calendar was a lunar calendar and was just that. A calendar based on the patterns of the moon’s orbit. It contained 10 months with 29 days or 30 days. The issue with the Lunar Calendar was that it is based off the moon, not the sun which we orbit. So the Lunar calendar was about 11 days short of the actual orbital period of the Earth and over the span of 3 years, the calendar was a month behind. This was catastrophic to farmers for obvious reasons. So in comes the Julian Calendar. 

The Julian Calendar was much improved to include 12 months and  365 days, including an extra day for leap year since they calculated the rotation to be 365.23 days (It’s amazing how adept they were even in 46 B.C.). This really improved lives over time since the seasons dates did not change as much but still was slightly incorrect. The true year is 365.242199 days. This may seem minuscule because it’s only 11 minutes and 14 seconds different, but over the course of a decade, that’s a day difference and sometimes a day makes all the difference. In comes the Gregorian Calendar. 

## The Gregorian Calendar

By 1582, the 11 minute and change difference the Julian Calendar did not account for had accumulated to 10 days and over time, it could become more and more a problem. So Pope Gregory XIII dropped 10 days from the year to accommodate the error and then they reorganized the leap year rules to make up for this problem. This included the rule that century years not divisible by 400 were not leap years, for example 1700. 

All countries adopted this immediately	and seemed to be a smooth process. 

## April Fool’s

Since the Spring seems to be a natural place for rebirth and new beginnings, the new year started in the last week of March or April. When the Gregorian Calendar was implemented, a change from this new year date to January 1st was put in place. The people who didn’t hear the news or forgot became the butt of jokes and hoaxes. One joke was to put fish on their backs and were referred to April Fish which symbolized an easily caught fish and gullible person. 

No one really knows the true origins as it seems many different events played a part. It could be tied to Hilaria in Rome, which people celebrated the end of March and dressed up. It could be tired to the vernal equinox when Mother Nature fooled everyone with changing weather. 

In the 18th century April Fool’s officially became a two day event in England where people were sent on fake errands and had tails or kick me signs put on them. While this seems to be the first evidence of actual April Fool’s Day, the switch from the Julian to the Gregorian calendar is most likely the seed which took root and spread through out our different cultures.
