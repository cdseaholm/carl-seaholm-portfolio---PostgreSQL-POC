# Astrophysics for People In A Hurry by Neil Degrass Tyson

Every so often, there is special person who comes along and is able to break down unbelievably complicated knowledge. They are able to efficiently communicate such complicated ideas, that a person with average intelligence can grapple with the essentials that are presented to them. This is what Neil Degrass Tyson is able to do with his book, Astrophysics for People In A Hurry. 

There are books such as A Short History of Everything by Bill Bryson, however what Tyson is able to do is explain such complicated material in a short manner. The book itself is only about 200 pages and is small enough to fit in your back pocket (If you really stuffed it in there). 

Without spoiling this book, he takes the Big Bang, to elements, to waves, to the creation of everything in the universe, to how we came to understand it all. He is very honest in his telling about what we as a human race, understand and don’t understand. Then, explains what we still don’t understand and how we are attempting to understand it. He does so with humor and wit, diving into the history that lead us to understand the universe. 

He begins with telling the reader how the universe is formed. From the Big Bang which as he put it, was a fraction of the size of a period at the end of this sentence and held all the matter of the universe. One item we don’t understand, is what happened before the big bang. However, from the Big Bang on, he is able to depict, how we got to this moment. 

He dives into the space in between planets and systems. How the universe is a constant battle between gravity, the initial explosion from the big bang and a mysterious factor called dark energy that helps drive the universe in all directions. He says in his book that without this dark energy, gravity would ultimately win and the universe would collapse on itself. 

Everything in this book is highly fascinating and nothing in the book is short of complicated. However, like I said, he breaks it all down in manageable bites.

If you’re at all interested in ideas such as dark matter, dark energy, debating flat earthers, understanding LED lightbulbs, what a microwave is or just getting a general sense of how we are what we are, I highly recommend this read. It’s not easy, so take notes but it’s shorter for a book and very informative.
